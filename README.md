# Hi, I'm Evangel 👋

I'm a **Software Engineer** in my final year at the University of Portsmouth, specializing in building **responsive, user-focused interfaces** that make complex systems feel simple. I enjoy working at the intersection of design and engineering, turning product ideas into functional, delightful experiences.

## 🚀 What I Do

I build **full-stack applications** with a frontend focus, collaborating with designers and product teams to ship features that users love. My experience spans:

- **Frontend-heavy applications** with React, Angular, and TypeScript
- **Real-time systems** using WebSockets for chat, video conferencing, and live collaboration
- **Data visualization** with charting libraries and complex grid interfaces
- **Startup leadership** — co-founded and led development of a project management platform

Currently working as a **Full-Stack Software Engineer at Marchex Inc**, building data-rich analytics dashboards with Angular and TypeScript.

## 💼 Professional Experience

- **Marchex Inc** — Building analytics dashboards and data visualization tools (Angular, TypeScript, C#)
- **Eli Lilly & Company** — Year-long industrial placement developing AI-enhanced chatbot interfaces and testing tools
- **Kevvlar (Co-founder & CTO)** — Led development of an all-in-one project management platform with real-time features
- **Weekend Social** — Redesigned entire app UI and built admin dashboards
- **Teaching & Mentoring** — Taught Python programming, game development, and productivity tools to students

### About Me:

Final year software engineer with a deep love for technology. My greatest joy is sharing knowledge and witnessing those 'aha' moments when concepts come alive for others. I'm also a business-minded individual who, in my spare time, co-founded ['Kevvlar'](https://kevvlar.com), a project management tool aimed at changing how projects are managed. I'm now eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a forward-thinking company.

### About Me:

I'm a passionate and driven software engineer, dedicated to utilizing technology for the betterment of others. Embracing new challenges brings me joy, especially when teaching and witnessing those **"aha" moments** in others.

As CTO and sole developer of [Kevvlar](https://kevvlar.com), a *project management tool*, I've honed my coding expertise and embraced effective collaboration.

I welcome feedback and approach every task with a beginner's mindset, striving for excellence and paying meticulous attention to detail. My focus is on making a positive impact in all endeavors.

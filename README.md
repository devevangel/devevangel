  I'm a passionate and motivated software engineer who enjoys leveraging technology to help others. I'm always eager to tackle new challenges and find great satisfaction in teaching others and experiencing those "aha" moments when they grasp a concept.
As the sole developer of the project management tool, Kevvlar, I have honed my coding skills and learned to collaborate effectively with others.
I'm open to feedback and believe in approaching every challenge with a beginner's mindset, continually striving for excellence with a keen eye for detail. Overall, I am a focused individual who seeks to make a positive impact in everything I do.
